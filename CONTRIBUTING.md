GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in **<LIBRARY_NAME>**. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/<LIBRARY_NAME>), [FAQ](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/<LIBRARY_NAME>/blob/master/README.md#faq) and [past issues](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/<LIBRARY_NAME>/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
